Statement of Purpose

My first introduction to machines was a computer during my formative years. I happily pursued it as a discipline in school, alongside various industrial visits where we were shown manufacturing establishments with huge machines. Those days, factories practiced manual production methods. Despite being aware of possibilities to automate processes, I lacked the necessary knowledge and skills to do so. Therefore, I decided to pursue my undergraduate program in Electronics and Communication. As part of the curriculum, I studied Software Development, Digital Signal Processing and Embedded Systems as electives. I also worked on team and individual projects in order to broaden my horizon with those lessons. I developed a dual-axis solar tracker as my final year project. The solar panel carried a light sensitive sensor (Light Dependent Resistors), which automatically detected the change in the intensity of light and aligned itself to the region of maximum intensity. The project was one of the few presented to external examiners and various heads of departments. Through this project, I learned Analog to Digital conversion (the intensity of light into numbers), the processing of digital signal to detect change in intensity and collaboration with other team members to develop the documentation and software for the project. It also helped me to improve my presentation skills since we had to demonstrate the project to an external examiner and heads of departments.

I pursued various summer trainings, both voluntary and compulsory. During my training on Mobile Architecture and Planning, I developed “Quizzical”, a Windows-based mobile application with the facility of a real-time quiz. I was chosen the best performer in this training and was rewarded with a Nokia Lumia 800 mobile phone by Nokia University Relations in collaboration with Microsoft. In my sophomore year, I pursued a program in Telecommunications with the Institute of Telecom Technology and Management, MTNL and proposed a theoretical solution to detect signal strengths in areas where network vehicles cannot reach. In the final year, I interned with Tevatron Technologies in Embedded Systems around AVR, Arduino and advanced micro-controllers like STM32. All these trainings helped me in gaining a deeper understanding of Internet of Things (IoT).

In order to experience the development of production-ready cloud platform based software products, in July 2015, I started working as a Software Engineer with Compro Technologies. At Compro, I have experienced to work on various web-development technologies and Agile Software Development. Currently, I am developing and designing ComproDLSTM – a micro-service architecture based e-learning product, and a cutting-edge next-generation collaboration tool based on WebRTC and WebSockets for VHL (Vista Higher Learning). These projects have fetched me management experience along with the ability to liaison with associates. I have also been rewarded with six increments in the last two years. Over these years, I have also become a solutions-based person and helped my team to resolve long-pending technical issues.

With such rich professional and academic experiences, my fascination for Master’s in Engineering Management has motivated me to apply to Duke University for graduate studies. I believe in the philosophy of your program and the student life you offer. Apart from providing an engineering degree, the program collaborates with an elite business school to offer a blend of a high-end engineering curriculum with a core business course. Being multi-disciplinary in nature, the program imbibes skills that will render a well-integrated approach so that I can use my acquired business education along with an engineering background to lead and take well-informed decisions in the field of technology.

At Duke University, I am keen on studying Finance in High-Tech Industries, Intellectual Property, Business Law and Entrepreneurship, because the knowledge of these subjects is rarely available while working in a technology firm. I would also be happy to explore electives like Innovation Management, Engineering Project Management and Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing, as these subjects will be supportive in advancing my knowledge and capacity in software project management. While researching on your University, I was excited to learn about your erudite faculty. Some of those I would like to be associated with are Jeffrey T. Glass for his contribution towards Innovation and Commercialization, and Charles (CJ) Skender for his contribution towards Finance and Accounting. I also learned about the MEM Program Development Committee members who work with the program’s leaders to plan student activities, coordinate student recruitment events and enhance industry relations. They overcome all student-industry barriers and facilitate greater opportunities. Your distinguished alumni across the globe will also be a huge asset in terms of guidance and support while I would aim to fulfil my goals. In a candid discussion with a current MEM student and friend, Heer Narang, I learned about the Duke Start-Up Challenge and Duke Smart Home, which sounded interesting. She also mentioned about the weekly seminars and the workshop series that develop entrepreneurial skills along with networking tactics, successful teamwork and cross-cultural communications.

Upon graduating from the University, I am keen on working with a globally prominent technology firm and using my skills to develop products and technologies that contribute towards sustainable development. Thereafter, I wish to establish my own venture in the domain of IoT or Smart devices. It will develop automation products that will help in improving our living standards. I might also mention here that I have pursued online courses through Coursera from the University of San Diego on IoT’s evolution, Sensing and Actuation from Devices and Multimedia Technologies. 

Therefore, I assure you of all cooperation during the admissions phase and beyond, in order to contribute as much as gain from the august academic environment you offer. I look forward to joining your fraternity.
